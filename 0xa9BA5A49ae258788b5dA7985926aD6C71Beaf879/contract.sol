Get your seat at the spaceship to the MARS

MARS Farm is your new home for yield farming in Binance Smart Chain network. Drop in, slide up to the bar, and start farming a high yield token in a safe and comfortable environment. In contrast to 95% of the yield farming projects previously launched, we have worked hard to make MARS’s launch and farming process as fair as possible. This means:
Pre-staking MARS has been enabled, avoiding a ninja launch.
The MINT function is INACCESSIBLE, meaning that the developers can never insta’mint more tokens for themselves.
MARS has ZERO developer premine.
100% of MARS’s distribution goes to farmers, with ZERO developer tax.
MARS has ZERO hidden pools
As a final gesture to align the development team’s motives with the longevity of the project, in lieu of a developer tax .5% of all LP tokens staked on the platform will be collected and used to verifiably buy MARS off the market and sent to a public burn address. This deflationary mechanism will balance out MARS’s high inflation distribution method.
Following our launch we will be pursuing a third-party audit to publicly verify these details, to ensure that MARS farmers can farm with peace of mind. If there are any third parties that want to audit the code in the meantime, they are welcome to do so
MARS tokens are a governance token that carry zero intrinsic value. These tokens are algorithmically distributed in proportion to the value one provides to the platform, through providing liquidity on select Uniswap markets and staking those LP tokens on MARS Farm. Following the release of MARS’s governance portal, MARS tokens will give owners a voice in the future direction and development of the project.
MARS has not been audited by a third party audit company. Check the website:

Symbosis

The MARS Farm team is excited to officially announce MARS Farm’s Symbiosis upgrade.
SYMBOSIS: After reviewing the latest in tokenomic designs, tapping into the innovations pioneered by coins such as CORE and many others, and brainstorming with our VIP community channel (the Champagne Lounge), we are excited to publicly reveal the next phase in MARS Farm’s evolution. The Symbosis upgrade will transition MARS from its current state as a high-inflation yield farming coin into an aggressively deflationary yield farming ecosystem.

MARS’s new token design uses a combination of community-governed flexible yields, unstaking and transfer taxes/burns, and tiered rewards for LP token staking lockups. These elements work together in symbiosis to create a deflationary token with sustainable high yields that incentivizes steady growth in MARS’s liquidity pools, as overall coin supply is steadily reduced through transactional tax token burns. MARS being unstaked and/or sold leads to more MARS being both burned and distributed to LP stakers as yield, which results in MARS becoming scarcer while simultaneously pushing yields steadily higher.
This positive feedback loop will result in MARS’s available sell pressure being consistently burned away or locked up earning yields by liquidity providers.
With Symbiosis we aim to 1. Achieve a state of deflation, reducing sell side supply and increasing MARS’s scarcity. 2. Incentivize liquidity in our LPs by providing sustainably high yields.
Locked MARS token staking rewards are on a sliding scale, where farmers are eligible to receive additional reward streams if they choose longer voluntary lockups. This removes sell pressure from the market and provides increased rewards to those who are providing the greatest value to the network and market. The highest tier of rewards (user fees from MARS Farm’s flagship product, REDACTED, currently under development) will only be available to those who permanently lock their liquidity in LP tokens — a secondary market for those locked LP tokens will be provided, however.
When Launch?
Mars’s Symbiosis upgrade will go live on MARCH 3rd. Leading up to the launch MARS 1.0 inflation will be halted, the current pools will be shutdown, a snapshot will be taken of holders’ token balances, MARS 2.0 will be distributed to holders’ wallets, and the updated pools with all their additional rewards will go live!
We will be publishing additional updates leading up to the launch. These will cover the swapping process, a detailed timeline, MARS’s governance portal, some internal burn and yield rate projections, and perhaps a sneak peak of MARS Farm’s flagship product. So keep an eye out here.
