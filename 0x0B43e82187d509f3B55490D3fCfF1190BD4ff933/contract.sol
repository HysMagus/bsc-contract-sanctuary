--- How to ---

You can mint fresh new BscDoge starting at 10 million BscDoge, going down linearly at every mint to a cap of 100 billion BscDoge.
Minting BscDoge are free. Just use the mint function from contract or go to the BscScan 'write contract' tab and click the mint button! 
However you cannot mint BscDoge to an account if it already has BscDoge. First tip your BscDoge to other people!

How to use BscDoge? If you want to tip someone, you can send some BscDoge to his/her address. 
There is a 50:50 chance that
1. your send will be successful 
OR
2. you will lose half of your BscDoge and donate them to the BscDoge Community Pool.

These lost BscDoge accumulate in BscDoge Community Pool and once in every 5 transfers, BscDoge Community Pool randomly send its BscDoge to one sender
assuming the sender will appreciate the tipping culture and tip others. So with every send you are playing a 1/5 dice to get a big amount of BscDoge.

Now, start to tip BscDoge to someone and get rewards for your kindness, good luck!

Mint for free from the contract and then just SEND IT!!
