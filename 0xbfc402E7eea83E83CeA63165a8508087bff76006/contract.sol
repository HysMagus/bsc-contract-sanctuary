/*
Just for buying $SIMI and holding it in your wallet, you will earn passive income that is deposited 
directly into your wallet via frictionless yield on all transactions of SIMSIMI. No staking required!

SIMSIMI combines Defiâ€™s best tokenomics into one: 
Each transaction incurs a 4% tax that is distributed in four equal parts: 
1% to holders, 1% burned to SIMI Hole, 1% locked liquidity, and 1% as a bonus to liquidity providers. 
As volume increases, the amount burned increases logarithmically, eventually leading to an exponential decrease in supply.

The SIMI Hole burns do not stop, the instant holder rewards do not stop, the 2x rewards for liquidity 
providers do not stop, and the locked liquidity adds do not stop. This means the $SIMI supply will 
become more scarce, your holdings will continue to increase and the price floor will continue to rise.

- Deflationary supply
- Rewards directly into your wallet
- 2x rewards for LP
- Automatic & locked liquidity adds
- Whale dump protection
