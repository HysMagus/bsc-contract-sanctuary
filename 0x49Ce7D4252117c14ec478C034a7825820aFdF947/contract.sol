      @dev Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
      `recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.
     
      https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
      of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
      imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
      `transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.
